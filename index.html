It defines the meaning    and    structure of    web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation    (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p><p class="text-about">"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website    or between    websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages    created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p><p class="text-gr">An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name    surrounded by <    and >. The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase,    or a mixture. For example, the title tag can be written as Title, TITLE, or in any other way. However, the    convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.</p><p class="text-gr" id="text">The articles below can help you learn more about HTML.</p><hr style="border: 2px solid lightblue;            width: 400px"><a href="grinch.html" target="_blank" class="nav">Read About Grinch </a><img src="./img/grinch.png" alt="christmas_grinch" class="img-grinch"></body></html>
